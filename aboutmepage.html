  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>
    Hi, I am <strong>Yolixtly</strong>. My life and goals are represented by the meaning of my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahuatl">Nahuatl</a> name which is Life itself: Evolution, Change, Flow, Love.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am thrilled to learn and expand my knowledge on different topics. I really enjoy learning about <strong>nutrition</strong> and implementing it in yummy healthy meals! My big interest on adopting a healthier lifestyle may be the topic that brighten my path towards the importance of technology in our life, and personally it made me realized the urgency of not only adopting it but most important the urgency of <strong>being part of the change by actively collaborating on its creation!</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    I graduated from <strong>Business School</strong> in Mexico on 2013, and since then I have been fortunate to travel and live in different parts of Asia and US with my husband Marcus and our Dog <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/9KDHVQSRk1/?taken-by=yolixtly">Mateo</a>. Today, starting my Frontend Web Development course with <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a> represents a new and exciting way of complementing my knowledge but specially "My entrance ticket" to a <strong>solid and successful professional career.</strong>
